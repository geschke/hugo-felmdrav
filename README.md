# Felmdrav - A Hugo Theme

Felmdrav is a clean and minimalistic Hugo theme, built on the
[Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework.

Felmdrav originates from **Tikva**, a theme originally developed by the author for **Grav CMS** and later ported to **Hugo**.
The Hugo version of Tikva was based on **Bootstrap 4** and selectively incorporated concepts from a parallel Bootstrap-based **WordPress** implementation of the same theme.

The Tikva theme for Hugo remains available but is now considered **deprecated**.

When migrating the Hugo theme from Bootstrap 4 to **Bootstrap 5**, it became clear that the required changes would not be backward-compatible. In addition to the framework upgrade, several structural improvements were introduced, including a more flexible grid system, configurable sidebars, updated icon handling, and additional content blocks.

To clearly distinguish this modernized Hugo theme from its predecessor, the project was renamed to **Felmdrav**, which is now the **Bootstrap 5–based successor of Tikva for Hugo**.

## Evolution and Design Goals

While Felmdrav retains the minimalist design principles of Tikva, it introduces several structural and technical improvements tailored specifically for Hugo:

* Migration to **Bootstrap 5** with a clean, modern markup
* A **flexible grid system** based on Bootstrap’s 12-column layout
* **Configurable sidebars** with global defaults and per-page overrides
* Replacement of Font Awesome with **Bootstrap Icons**
* A small set of reusable **content blocks**, such as hero sections and feature/icon blocks
* Integration of multiple **Bootswatch** styles with additional custom refinements
* Optional color and style adjustments via configuration

The focus is on **clarity, predictability, and extensibility**, rather than feature overload or heavy abstraction.

## Philosophy

Felmdrav aims to stay:

* minimal in structure
* explicit in configuration
* easy to reason about
* flexible without becoming complex

Most layout behavior is controlled through clear configuration options, avoiding hidden defaults or implicit logic wherever possible.


## Features

* Responsive, mobile-first design based on **Bootstrap 5**
* Flexible **grid system** using Bootstrap’s 12-column layout
* Configurable **sidebars** with global defaults and per-page overrides
* Support for **one-, two- and three-column layouts**
* Integration of **Bootstrap Icons** (no Font Awesome dependency)
* Multiple built-in visual styles, including selected **Bootswatch** themes
* Reusable **content blocks** (e.g. hero sections, feature/icon blocks)
* Context-aware **content listing system** with recursive sections, sorting, and aggregation via front matter
* Customizable typography settings, including **Google Fonts** support
* Flexible footer and optional subfooter areas
* Optional analytics integration (Google Analytics, Matomo)
* Support for custom CSS and JavaScript via placeholder partials


Felmdrav requires Hugo ≥ 0.146.0, as it is based on the new directory and template structure introduced in recent Hugo versions.


## Demo

A live demo of the theme, based on the included `exampleSite`, is available here:
