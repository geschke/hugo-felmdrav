With the latest updates to the Felmdrav theme, we’re introducing **Featured Posts** — a simple way to highlight selected content where it matters most.

Featured Posts allow you to draw attention to important articles, announcements, or updates without mixing them into the regular blog flow. Instead of relying on automatic ordering, featured content is **explicitly curated**, making it ideal for landing pages or front pages.

Whether you want to promote a major release, an editorial highlight, or a key announcement, Featured Posts give you full control over how and where important content is presented.

In the example site, Featured Posts are used to demonstrate how curated content can complement a regular blog or archive view.
