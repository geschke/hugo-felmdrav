The **Felmdrav Hugo theme** is now officially released.

Felmdrav is designed with a clear focus on minimal structure, explicit configuration, and flexible content presentation. Built on Bootstrap 5, it supports a wide range of use cases—from simple blogs to more complex, content-driven websites.

Key features include a configurable grid system, reusable content blocks, flexible content listings, and curated Featured Posts for prominent content placement.

This first public release establishes a solid foundation for further development. While the theme will continue to evolve, it is already intended for real-world use and customization.
