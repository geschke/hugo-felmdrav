This sidebar represents a **secondary sidebar**, commonly used for a table of contents or contextual navigation.

In real-world projects, this area is often populated automatically (for example with a generated table of contents), but for demonstration purposes it contains static content.

##### Example sections

- Introduction
- Configuration
- Layout options
- Notes

This sidebar is intentionally simple to keep the focus on the **layout structure**, not on functionality.
